### 👩‍💻 Who am I?

Hey! I'm Gizem — a fullstack developer passionate about transforming enterprise complexity into smart, scalable, and cloud-native solutions.  
I'm currently crafting intelligent applications on **SAP Business Technology Platform**, where systems don't just function — they **respond, predict, and learn**.

I enjoy writing clean code, building delightful UIs with **UI5**, connecting APIs, and deploying services.  
Whether it's a CAP service, a Google Maps-integrated Fiori app, or a GitHub Actions pipeline, I'm probably tinkering with it.
